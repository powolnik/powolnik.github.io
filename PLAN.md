# Portfolio Website Implementation Plan for powolnik (GitHub)

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the development of a professional portfolio site showcasing your game development expertise in UnrealEngine/Python/Kotlin, and AI, emphasizing technical problem-solving through embedded project demos and case studies. The implementation will use either Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for a native application approach or Python with a modern web framework for a web-based approach. The final deliverable will serve as both a personal showcase and a recruitment tool for freelance opportunities.

## Phase 1: Research & Planning (2 weeks)

### Tasks:
- Competitive analysis of indie game dev portfolios
- Decision point: Kotlin+Jetpack Compose (for desktop/Android) OR Python+Flask/Django (for web)
- Create low-fidelity mockups of key screens/pages
- Define minimalist design system focused on code presentation
- Establish content strategy for case studies and project documentation
- Update PROGRESS.md after completing each task

### Deliverables:
- Technology stack decision document with justification
- Approved wireframes + simple style guide
- Prioritized feature backlog
- Content outline for projects and case studies
- PROGRESS.md with completed Phase 1 tasks

## Phase 2: Core Framework Development (3 weeks)

### Tech Stack Setup:
- **For Kotlin+Jetpack Compose path:**
  - Set up Kotlin project with Jetpack Compose dependencies
  - Configure theme and typography system
  - Establish navigation component
  
- **For Python path:**
  - Set up Python virtual environment with Flask/Django
  - Configure database for project storage (SQLite for simplicity)
  - Create base templates and static assets structure

### Implementation:
1. Base structure with navigation framework
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion
2. Responsive layout system
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion
3. Routing/navigation system
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion
4. Basic animation framework
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion
5. Data storage layer for projects
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion

### Key Milestones:
- Working navigation shell with all screen/page templates
- Dark/light theme toggle functionality
- Basic portfolio card components
- PROGRESS.md updated with all Phase 2 completions

## Phase 3: Content & Feature Integration (4 weeks)

### Core Features Implementation:
1. Project showcase grid/list with:
   - Category filtering system
   - Tech stack indicators
   - Project screenshots/thumbnails
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion of each component
   
2. Skills visualization (simpler alternative to radar chart)
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion
   
3. Contact information or simple contact form
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion

### Content Production:
- Write 5 case studies following "Problem/Solution/Result" format
- Optimize media assets for your chosen platform
- Create simple custom icons for portfolio categories
- Update PROGRESS.md upon completion of content milestones

---

## Phase 4: Platform Optimization & Refinement (2 weeks)

### Critical Tasks:
1. Accessibility improvements:
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios
   - Add appropriate labels to all interactive elements
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion
   
2. Performance improvements:
   - Code optimization
   - Media optimization
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion
   
3. Platform-specific enhancements:
   - **For Kotlin:** Package for desktop distribution
   - Update PROGRESS.md upon completion

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (1 week)

### Testing Matrix:
| Platform | Testing Focus |
|----------|--------------|
| Desktop  | Functionality, Navigation, Responsiveness |
| Mobile   | Touch interactions, Layout (if applicable) |

### Final Deliverables:
- For Kotlin: Packaged application for distribution
- For Python: Deployed website with hosting provider (e.g., PythonAnywhere, Heroku, Vercel)
- Documentation repository with setup instructions
- PROGRESS.md with complete project history

### Post-Launch:
- Plan for iterative improvements based on feedback
- Strategy for keeping portfolio updated with new projects
