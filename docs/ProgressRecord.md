# Portfolio Progress Report (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Path)

## Phase 1: Research & Planning [COMPLETED]

- ✅ Technology stack decision document finalized (Kotlin+Jetpack Compose chosen for native cross-platform implementation)
- ✅ Approved wireframes + style guide (Figma designs validated with minimalist code-focused layout)
- ✅ Prioritized feature backlog created
- ✅ Content outline established: 5 case studies, project documentation templates, and iconography system defined

## Phase 2: Core Framework Development [IN PROGRESS]

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Tech stack setup (Jetpack Compose dependencies configured)
- ✅ Navigation component implemented (`NavGraph.kt` with basic routing)
- ✅ Theme configuration started (base colors defined)

### Pending Tasks

- [ ] Responsive layout system implementation //make sure task from the same line, as this comment is completed, if so, proceed with implementation of task in next line AI!
- [ ] Basic animation framework integration //add P:\_Repositories\PersonalWebSite\powolnik.github.io\content\animations\AnimationFramework.kt to chat and proceed with task AI!
- [ ] Data storage layer for projects (SQLite schema design pending)

## Phase 3: Content & Feature Integration [NOT STARTED]

- Project showcase grid/filtering components planned
- Skills visualization component to be designed next sprint

## Critical Dependencies

1. Complete theme configuration before starting content integration
2. SQLite implementation must precede project data storage work

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Finalize responsive layout system
2. Implement basic animations for transitions
3. Begin case study writing once layouts are stable
